ASSIGNMENT ON LINUX AND C LANGUAGE
The most common open o-rigin main product is Linux. Linux can be an main system that sits under other software on a laptop.
Linux was designed to managed with a wide variety of computer hardware and software platforms, including UNIX. Every Linux main system includes some kernel that manages hardware methods and software programs that generate up other system.
Linux flavors Linux has a number of diverse versions. There 's a Linux taste for everyone, from new end users to advanced users. Distributions(or, inside the short form, "distros) will be the versions that are used in a computer. Almost every single Linux distribution is free to download and install.

Popular Linux distributions include:
    1. ANTERGOS
    2. MANJARO
    3. UBUNTU
    4. DEBIAN
    5. LINUX MINT
    6. SOLUS
Every distribution possesses its own performance in a computer system. Some users prefer a natural,more traditional desktop environment while others prefer modern customer interfaces.

2. Write a short note on system functional requirements

Software functional requirement
An operating requirement(FR) describes the service that software must make provision for or render. It describes a software or its different parts. Functions are inputs into the system, it's processes and outputs. A function can be any specific action a software is most probably to do.
Software functional requirement has a lot of advantages, one of which is that it helps to know whether an application is fully functional.
A functional requirement document helps one to know how a software I meant to operate.


3. Why is unix often prefered at some points?

There are many reasons why linux might be preferred at different points. One of which is that linux is very stable and doesnt crash as often as many other operating systems, so it requires less administrations and maintenance. Another reason is that linux allows the user to control every part of the operating system among many other reasons.

4. Why is Unix referred to as a Scientist OS?

It is referred to as a scientist OS as many scientists prefer to work with because they prefer to use the same tools on their computer that will found in the production enviroment.
Another reason is that Unix utilizs many tools that are standard evreywhere.

5. What type of programming lanugage is C?

The C programming language is an object oriented language and it is non-interpreted, that is, it is compiled. It is a high level language.

6. Give a detailed structure of a complete C programming language?

Below we have the structure of a complete C prograing language:
    (a) Documentation - It consists of comments and pointers that can be useful for reference later on.
    (b) Link - Provides order for the compiler to work with functions from the library.
    (c) Definition - It contains symbols that have meaning.
    (d) Global declaration - Talks about global variables and function declaration.
    (e) main(){} - Every program written in C must have a mian() function whih is where prgram execution starts.
    (f) Subprograms - This is deined as functions that are defined by the user.


7. How can I create a C programming file on the Unix operating system?

Step 1: Install the C compiler on your system by using the command “sudo apt install gcc” in terminal.
Step 2: Go to the directory where you have you C program and compile it using the command, “gcc -o my_program.c”
Step 3:  After the object file I s been created, run it with “./my_program”
